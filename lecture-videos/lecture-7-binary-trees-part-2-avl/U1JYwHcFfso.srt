00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,920
ERIK DEMAINE: All right, welcome
back to data structures land.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,140
Today we continue and complete
our segment on binary trees.

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,030
So this is part two.

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,180
If you missed part one, go
back and watch part one.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,650
Last time, we talked about
binary trees in general.

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:36,980
We had each node stored an
item, and also a left pointer

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,570
and a right pointer
to other nodes,

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,420
and a parent pointer
to another node.

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,910
This was an example of a tree.

11
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,965
B, and C are A's children.

12
00:00:45,965 --> 00:00:49,010
A is the parent of B
and C, and also the root

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,330
of the entire tree.

14
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,847
We defined the height of a node.

15
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:53,180
We didn't use this too much yet.

16
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,763
But we're going to
use it a lot today.

17
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:58,460
So remember, the height
is as drawn in red here.

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,390
Height of the node is the length
of the longest downward path

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,230
counting edges.

20
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,510
So B, for example,
has a length 2 paths.

21
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,070
So we write a 2 here.

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,560
You can also think
of it as if you just

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,600
live within the subtree
rooted at B, B subtree,

24
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,612
then what is the maximum
depth of those nodes,

25
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:19,320
if you prefer to think
about it that way.

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,750
Either way is fine.

27
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,730
And in particular,
we distinguished

28
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,460
h, the height of the
root node, as the height

29
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,360
of the entire tree.

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,450
And what we achieved
last time was basically

31
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,850
all of our operations
ran in order h time.

32
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,730
So we had subtree insert,
subtree delete, subtree first

33
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,270
and last.

34
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,187
We could compute the
predecessor and successor

35
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:42,780
of a node, all in order h time.

36
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,170
So as long as h was
small, we were happy.

37
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,510
And remember, what does
predecessor and successor mean?

38
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,320
It's talking about an implicit
order in the tree, which

39
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,590
is what we call traversal order,
which is defined recursively

40
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,330
as recursively traverse the left
subtree, then output the root,

41
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,040
then recursively traverse
the right subtree.

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,520
So in this example, the
traversal order is F is the--

43
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,130
if you go all the way
left, that was the first

44
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,930
in the traversal order.

45
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,430
Then we have-- right, I'll
make me some space here.

46
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,140
Then we have D,
then we have B. Then

47
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,000
we do the right
subtree of B, which

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,590
is E. Then we have the
root, because we finished

49
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,310
the left subtree of the root.

50
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,220
So that's A. And then we have C.

51
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,910
So there's an implicit linear
order encoded by this tree.

52
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,770
And the whole point
of binary trees

53
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,220
is that we can efficiently
update the tree much faster

54
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,160
than we could explicitly write
down an order in an array

55
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,130
or something like that.

56
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,480
So binary trees let us quickly--

57
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,520
now, quickly is not
so quick right now.

58
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,990
Because everything is order h.

59
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,790
And in the worst
case, h is linear.

60
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,350
Because we can have
a tree like this.

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,120
But today, we're going
to make-- we're going

62
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,490
to guarantee that h is log n.

63
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,050
And so the goal of
today is to take

64
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,080
all of these operations
that run in order h time

65
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,405
and get them to run an
order log n time, just

66
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:16,530
by modifying the data
structure we've already seen.

67
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,822
So we've done a lot of the
hard work, just a little bit

68
00:03:18,822 --> 00:03:21,590
more work we need to do
today on something called

69
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,370
AVL trees or height balance.

70
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,650
But before we get there, I want
to talk a little bit more--

71
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,150
at the very end of
the last lecture,

72
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,970
we talked about once you have
these subtree operations--

73
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,110
so I can insert and
delete in the subtree--

74
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,780
how do I actually use that to
solve the problems that we care

75
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,630
about in this class, which are
sequence data structure and set

76
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,870
data structure?

77
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,910
So we talked mostly about the
set data structure last time.

78
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,810
So in general, we're going to
define what traversal order

79
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,780
we maintain by a binary tree.

80
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,730
And so for a set, because
for the set interface,

81
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,700
we're interested in doing
queries like find_next

82
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,642
and find_previous, given
a key, if it's not there,

83
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:06,350
tell me the previous
one or the next one,

84
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,720
this is something we could
do with binary search.

85
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,170
And so the big, cool thing
that binary trees let us do,

86
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,279
if we let the traversal order
always be all of the items

87
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,680
stored in increasing
key order, then we

88
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,450
are effectively maintaining
the items in order--

89
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,680
in the traversal order sense.

90
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,210
Again, we're not explicitly
maintaining them in order.

91
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,840
But up here, we're
maintaining a tree that

92
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,300
represents items in key order.

93
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,640
And so this lets us do a
subtree_find operation--

94
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,220
which you could easily
use to implement find,

95
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,500
and find_previous, and so on--

96
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,800
as follows.

97
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,890
We start at the
root of the tree.

98
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,770
So we can say, node
equals root initially.

99
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,770
And then we can recursively
search for a key k as follows.

100
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,900
We check, well, if
the item at the root

101
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,490
has a key that's bigger than k--

102
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,890
let me draw a little picture.

103
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,348
So we're at some node here.

104
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:10,220
This is a node.

105
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,550
And it has left subtree
and a right subtree.

106
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,780
And there's some
item with some key.

107
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,260
So if the key we're looking for
is less than the node's item,

108
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,080
that means it's down
here in the left subtree.

109
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,510
And so we recurse on node.left.

110
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,900
If they're equal, that
means that this item

111
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,150
is the item we're looking for.

112
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,848
So we can just return
it or the node,

113
00:05:30,848 --> 00:05:32,390
depending on what
you're looking for.

114
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,690
And if the key in here
is greater than the key

115
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,650
we're looking for, then
we'll recurse to the right.

116
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,570
If you think about
it a little bit,

117
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,600
this is exactly binary
search on an array.

118
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,120
It just happens to
be on a tree instead.

119
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:55,330
If you think of an
array like this,

120
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,500
what does binary search do?

121
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,340
It first looks at the
key in the middle.

122
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,160
I'm going to draw
that as the root.

123
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,060
And then, it recurses
either on the left chunk,

124
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,110
which I will draw recursively,
or on the right chunk.

125
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,240
And so if you happen to
have a perfect binary

126
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,690
tree like this one, it
is simulating exactly

127
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,048
binary search in this array.

128
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:17,590
But this we're going to be able
to maintain dynamically-- not

129
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,690
perfect any more, but close.

130
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,180
Whereas this we could not
maintain in sorted order.

131
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,160
So this is like a
generalization of binary search

132
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,670
to work on trees
instead of on arrays.

133
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,445
And for this reason, set binary
trees are called binary search

134
00:06:34,445 --> 00:06:36,820
trees, because they're the
tree version of binary search.

135
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,450
So there's many
equivalent names.

136
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,140
So binary search tree is another
name for set binary tree.

137
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,720
And the key thing that
makes this algorithm work is

138
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,970
the so-called binary
search tree property, which

139
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:50,050
is all the keys in the
left subtree of a node

140
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,100
are less than the
root, or of that node,

141
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,880
and that key is less than all
the keys in the right subtree.

142
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,380
And this is true recursively
all the way down.

143
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,950
And so that's how you prove
that this algorithm is

144
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,850
correct by this property.

145
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,170
Why is this true?

146
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,160
Because if we can
maintain traversal order

147
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,010
to be increasing
key, then that's

148
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,983
exactly what
traversal order means.

149
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:16,150
It tells you all the things
in the left subtree come

150
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,070
before the root, which
come before all the things

151
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,945
in the right subtree.

152
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:23,680
So this property
implies this one.

153
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,110
And how do you maintain things
in increasing key order?

154
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,790
It's pretty easy.

155
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,240
If you want to insert an
item, where does it belong?

156
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,760
Well, you do this
search to find where it

157
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,380
would belong if it was there.

158
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,260
If it's there, you can overwrite
the value stored with that key.

159
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,393
If it's not, this
search will fall off

160
00:07:42,393 --> 00:07:43,810
the tree at some
point, and that's

161
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,850
where you insert a
new node in your tree.

162
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,610
That was covered in recitation,
so I don't want to dwell on it.

163
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,920
What I want to focus on today
is the other application.

164
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,160
How do we-- this is for
representing a set, which

165
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,080
is relatively easy.

166
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,960
A challenge to sort of
set ourselves up for,

167
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,970
but we need a
little more work, is

168
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,540
to make sequence binary trees.

169
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,787
So suppose I have a binary
tree, and what I would like--

170
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:12,370
we mentioned at the
end of last time--

171
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,640
is that I want the
traversal order of my tree

172
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,470
to be the sequence
order, the order that I'm

173
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,960
trying to represent that's
changed by operations

174
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,380
like insert_at.

175
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,473
So I'd just like to
do the same thing.

176
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:30,640
But now, I have to think
about how do I do a search,

177
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,650
how do I do a insert_at,
that sort of thing.

178
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,789
And here is an algorithm for
what I would like to work.

179
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,059
But it's not going
to quite work yet.

180
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:45,700
So suppose I give you a
subtree, so specified by a node.

181
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,060
So there's all the
descendants of that node.

182
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,360
And I'd like to know what
is in the traversal order

183
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,570
of that subtree, which
starts here, and ends here,

184
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,250
and the root will be
somewhere in the middle.

185
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,100
Give me the ith node.

186
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,430
So if I ask i equals
0, I want to get

187
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,230
this leftmost descendant.

188
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,800
If I ask for i equals the
size of the tree minus 1,

189
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,380
I want to get the
rightmost descendant.

190
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,835
That was the first and
last in the subtree

191
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:14,710
that we talked about.

192
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,840
But we know how to find
the first and last.

193
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,220
Just walk left or walk right.

194
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,180
But we don't know how
to find the ith node--

195
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,110
in order h time is the
goal right now, not log n.

196
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,400
And the idea is, well, it
seems like size matters.

197
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,070
[CHUCKLES] Sorry if
you heard otherwise.

198
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,940
So in particular,
I mentioned size

199
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,300
when I was talking about the
last node in the sequence.

200
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,860
The index of that node is
size of the subtree minus 1.

201
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:51,250
So let's define
the size of a node

202
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:57,310
to be the number of
nodes in its subtree--

203
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,050
we were calling
that subtree(node)--

204
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,100
including the node itself.

205
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,340
So if I somehow
knew the size, this

206
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,590
seems important for
understanding indexes.

207
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,530
Let's just assume that
I knew that magically

208
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,280
in constant time.

209
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,200
Then, I claim that the
size of the left subtree--

210
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,350
so why don't I expand
this diagram a little bit?

211
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,910
So we have node as before.

212
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:36,120
But we have left subtree
and a right subtree.

213
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,700
So this node here is node.left.

214
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,080
This node here is node.right.

215
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,500
They might not exist, but let's
ignore those exceptional cases

216
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,760
for now.

217
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,190
Let's suppose we knew not
only the size of node,

218
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,280
but we knew the
size of node.left,

219
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,780
so that is the size of
this tree on the left.

220
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,070
I'm going to call that nL.

221
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,000
So let's suppose that there
are nL nodes down here.

222
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,770
I claim that lets me do the
equivalent of a binary search.

223
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,440
Because I'm looking
for some index i.

224
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,737
And if i is less than nL, then I
know that it must be down here.

225
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,320
For example, if i
equals 0, it's going

226
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,490
to be in the left subtree, as
long as nL is greater than 0,

227
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:16,990
right?

228
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,190
So that's exactly this check.

229
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,080
If i is less than nL,
I'm going to recurse

230
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,860
to the left, call subtree
at of node.left, i.

231
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,830
That's what's written here.

232
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,430
If i equals nL, if you think
about it for a second-- so nL

233
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,150
is the number of nodes here.

234
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,340
And so that means this
node has index nL.

235
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,500
The index of this node is nL.

236
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,770
And so if i equals-- if the
one index we're looking for

237
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,780
is that one, then we
just return this node.

238
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,460
We're done.

239
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,920
And otherwise, i
is greater than nL.

240
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,930
And that means that the
node we're looking for

241
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,590
is in the right subtree,
because it comes after the root.

242
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,263
Again, that's what it means.

243
00:11:56,263 --> 00:11:57,680
That's what traversal
order means.

244
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,830
So if we define it
to be sequence order,

245
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,920
then we know all the things
that come after this node, which

246
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,120
is index nL, must be over here.

247
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,870
Now when we recurse down here,
our numbering system changes.

248
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,320
Because for node, 0 is here.

249
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,060
And then for node.right is here.

250
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,630
So we need to do a little bit
of subtraction here, which

251
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,310
is when we recurse
to the right, we

252
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,580
take i minus nL minus 1--
minus nL for these guys,

253
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,925
minus 1 for the root node.

254
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:27,800
And that will give us
the index we're looking

255
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,980
for within this subtree.

256
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,400
So my point is, this
algorithm is basically

257
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,600
the same as this algorithm.

258
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,080
But this one uses keys, because
we're dealing with a set,

259
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,450
and in sets we assume
items have keys.

260
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,520
Over here, items don't
have to have keys.

261
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,810
In fact, we're not
touching the items at all.

262
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,823
We're just asking, what is the
ith item in my sequence, which

263
00:12:49,823 --> 00:12:52,490
is the same thing as what is the
ith item in my traversal order,

264
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,560
which is the same thing
as asking what is the ith

265
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,600
node in the traversal order?

266
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,310
And this algorithm
gives it to you

267
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,090
exactly the same
way in order h time.

268
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,630
Now, I'm not going to show
you all the operations.

269
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:11,930
But you can use subtree_at
to implement get_at set_at.

270
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,050
You just find the appropriate
node and return the item

271
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,180
or modify the item.

272
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,070
Or you can use it to--

273
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,950
most crucially, you can use
it to do insert_at delete_at.

274
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,090
This is a new thing we've
never been able to do before.

275
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,970
What do you do?

276
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,670
Just like over here, if I'm
trying to insert an item,

277
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:33,300
I search for that
item over here.

278
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,710
So if I'm trying to insert at
i, for example, I look for i.

279
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:43,490
And then for insert_at i,
want to add a new item just

280
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,990
before that one.

281
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,870
And conveniently,
we already have--

282
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,810
I didn't mention, but we
have a subtree insert.

283
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,470
We had two versions--
before and after.

284
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:59,270
I think we covered after,
which I use successor

285
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,130
before I use predecessor.

286
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,280
But we can just
call subtree insert

287
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:09,470
before at that node, and
boom, we will have added

288
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,230
a new item just before it.

289
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,710
And great, so
magically, somehow, we

290
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,080
have inserted in the
middle of this sequence.

291
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,980
And all of the indices update,
because I'm not storing

292
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,210
indices.

293
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,730
Instead, to search for
an item at index i,

294
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,820
I'm using the search algorithm.

295
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,460
But there's a problem.

296
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,300
What's the problem?

297
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,190
This seems a little
too good to be true.

298
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,500
I insert in the
middle of this tree,

299
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,350
and then somehow, I can
magically search and still

300
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,350
find the ith item, even though
all the indices to the right

301
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,760
of that item incremented by 1.

302
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,720
It's almost true.

303
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,220
Answer?

304
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,280
Yeah?

305
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,755
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

306
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:03,130
ERIK DEMAINE: Because we have
to update the sizes, right.

307
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,350
I didn't say, how do I compute
the size of the left subtree?

308
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,660
So that is the next topic.

309
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,850
We're almost done.

310
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,510
This will actually work.

311
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,780
It's really quite awesome.

312
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,790
But for it to work,
we need something

313
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,837
called subtree
augmentation, which

314
00:15:22,837 --> 00:15:23,920
I'll talk about generally.

315
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,390
And then, we'll
apply it to size.

316
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,590
So the idea with
subtree augmentation

317
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:37,900
is that each node
in our binary tree

318
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:45,100
can store a constant
number of extra fields.

319
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,780
Why not?

320
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,750
And in particular,
if these fields

321
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,610
are of a particular type--

322
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,260
maybe I'll call them properties.

323
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:10,030
I'm going to define
a subtree property

324
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:21,330
to be something
that can be computed

325
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,520
from the properties of
the nodes' children.

326
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,780
So I should say
this is of a node.

327
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:42,030
So children are
node.left and node.right.

328
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,655
You can also access constant
amount of other stuff,

329
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:47,620
for example the node itself.

330
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,140
But the point of
a subtree property

331
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,490
is it's downward looking.

332
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:57,360
If I have a node
here, and I want

333
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,750
to compute some
property about it--

334
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:06,000
call it, we want to
store P of the node--

335
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,270
and suppose we already
know P over here,

336
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,910
the property computed
for the left subtree

337
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,710
or for the left
node, and we already

338
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:17,970
know the property for the
right node, then what I'd like

339
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,369
is for this to be
computable in constant time.

340
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,750
So I can compute P of this
node given P of the left node

341
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,870
and P of the right node.

342
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,340
That's a subtree property.

343
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:38,340
Now, in particular, size
is a substrate property.

344
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,510
Why?

345
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:43,830
Because I can write
this kind of recurrence,

346
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:49,282
node.size equals
node.left.size--

347
00:17:49,282 --> 00:17:52,470
this is very tedious to write--

348
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:59,580
plus node.right.size, plus?

349
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,955
1, thank you.

350
00:18:05,955 --> 00:18:11,185
The size of the entire
subtree here, called node,

351
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:13,810
is the size of the left subtree
plus size of the right subtree,

352
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,290
plus 1 for that node itself.

353
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,865
So this is an update rule.

354
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,530
It takes constant
time to evaluate.

355
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,990
It's two editions.

356
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,250
Sorry, my t's look kind
of like plus signs.

357
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,390
I'll make the pluses
a little bigger.

358
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,030
So we're just summing
those three things.

359
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,020
Boom, we can get node.size.

360
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:46,980
So I claim that as long as
my property has this feature,

361
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,680
I can maintain it dynamically
as I'm changing the tree.

362
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,722
Now, this is a little bit
of a forward reference,

363
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:55,430
because we haven't
said exactly how we're

364
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,638
going to change the tree yet.

365
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:57,710
But question?

366
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,100
AUDIENCE: If node.size
is recursive,

367
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,290
then how is it happening
in constant time?

368
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,150
Wouldn't it be
happening [INAUDIBLE]??

369
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,275
ERIK DEMAINE: Why is this--

370
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:07,290
OK, good question.

371
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,080
So one natural
way, you can think

372
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,850
of this as a recursion,
which gives you

373
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,750
a recursive algorithm.

374
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,780
So I wrote-- but
didn't write it.

375
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,140
But I could have written
size of node equals this--

376
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,910
size of node.left
plus-- and that

377
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,030
would give you a linear time
algorithm to count the size.

378
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,710
And if you don't
have any information,

379
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,218
that is what you would do.

380
00:19:27,218 --> 00:19:28,510
And that would be very painful.

381
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,427
So that would make this
algorithm really slow.

382
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:33,860
If I'm calling size as a
recursive function, it's bad.

383
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,410
What I'm instead doing
is storing the sizes

384
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:41,510
on every single node
and pre-computing this.

385
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:46,220
So in fact, I'm going to
define the size of node in--

386
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,440
so this is the definition
mathematically.

387
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,000
But the algorithm
for this function

388
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,600
is just going to be
return node.size.

389
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,610
So that's constant time.

390
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,100
So the challenge now is I
have to keep these sizes up

391
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,470
to date, no matter
what I do to the tree.

392
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,450
And you could look
back at last lecture

393
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,500
and see, OK, what were all the
changes that I did in a tree?

394
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,620
We only did changes
during insert and delete.

395
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:16,940
And I will just claim to you,
when we did insert and delete,

396
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,640
what they ended up
doing in the end,

397
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:29,090
they add or remove
a leaf of the tree.

398
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:39,170
Remember, a leaf was a
node with no children.

399
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,730
So let's just think about if
I add a new leaf in a tree--

400
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,440
here's a tree, suppose
I add a leaf here--

401
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,160
which subtrees change?

402
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,570
Well, which subtrees
contain that node?

403
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,040
It is its own new subtree.

404
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,480
Then it's in its parent subtree,
and its grandparent subtree,

405
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,970
and the overall subtree.

406
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,240
In general, these nodes
are called the ancestors

407
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,250
of this node that we added.

408
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,930
And those are the
ones that update.

409
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,360
This subtree over
here didn't change.

410
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,560
It didn't change size.

411
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,770
And because it's a
subtree property,

412
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,520
no subtree property
will change over here,

413
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,370
because the subtree
was untouched.

414
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:22,630
So when I touch this
guy, I just have

415
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,610
to update the subtree
property here,

416
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,990
update the subtree
property here,

417
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,190
update subtree property here.

418
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,357
How many of these are there?

419
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,730
Yeah?

420
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,500
h-- I'll say order h to be safe.

421
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,090
But I think it's exactly h.

422
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,610
So also, when I remove
a leaf, the same thing--

423
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,830
if I remove this leaf,
then the subtrees

424
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,870
that change are exactly
its former ancestors.

425
00:21:51,430 --> 00:22:01,360
Cool, so we're going
to update those order h

426
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:13,770
ancestors in order up the tree.

427
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,950
So what do I mean by update?

428
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,740
I mean apply this rule.

429
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,810
For size, it's this rule.

430
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,540
But in general, the
subtree property

431
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,250
gives me an update rule
that takes constant time.

432
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,820
And so I'm going to
apply that update rule

433
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,570
to this node, which will fix
whatever property is stored

434
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,560
in there.

435
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,130
Maybe there's more
than one property.

436
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,630
And then I'll apply
it to this node.

437
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,040
And because this is already
correct by induction,

438
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,470
and this is already correct
because I didn't touch this

439
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,030
subtree-- it's unchanged--

440
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,790
then I can update the
value at this node--

441
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,160
the property at this
node in constant time.

442
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,200
Then I update this one.

443
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,468
And because this one is
already correct by induction,

444
00:22:53,468 --> 00:22:55,760
and this one is already
correct because this subtree is

445
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,880
unchanged, I can update
the property correctly here

446
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,500
in constant time.

447
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,170
So when I make a
change in order h time,

448
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,200
because I'm making h calls to
this constant time algorithm,

449
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,570
I can update a constant
number of subtree properties.

450
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,620
This is very powerful.

451
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,660
Data structure augmentation
is super useful.

452
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,160
You will use it on
your problem set.

453
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,080
We will use it again today.

454
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,550
Let me give you some examples
of subtree properties.

455
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:35,060
They could be-- common ones are,
like, the sum, or the product,

456
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:42,290
or the min, or the
max, or sum of squares,

457
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:50,090
or all sorts of
things, of some feature

458
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,055
of every node in the subtree.

459
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,310
In fact, subtree size is
an example of such a thing.

460
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,990
It is the sum over all nodes
in the subtree of the value 1.

461
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,510
It's another way to say
count the number of nodes.

462
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,460
But you could also
say, what's the sum

463
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,697
of the keys in these nodes?

464
00:24:11,697 --> 00:24:14,030
Or you could say, what's the
maximum key in these nodes?

465
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:21,737
Or you could say, what is the
maximum value in these nodes?

466
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:22,820
You can take any property.

467
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,900
It doesn't have to be key.

468
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,775
It doesn't have to be
anything in particular.

469
00:24:25,775 --> 00:24:26,730
It's very powerful.

470
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,808
You can take all sums,
products and maintain them

471
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:30,350
as long as they're
downward looking--

472
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,890
as long as you're only
thinking about the subtree.

473
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:38,860
Some examples of things
you cannot maintain are--

474
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,345
not a nodes index.

475
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,750
So if you get a little bit too
excited about augmentation,

476
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,150
you might think, oh,
I could do everything.

477
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,850
I needed to support
subtree_at, or let's

478
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,370
just say, get_at
globally, I wanted

479
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,500
to know what is the
ith node in my tree?

480
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,690
Well, I'll just use data
structure augmentation

481
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:09,240
and store in every node what is
its index, 0 through n minus 1.

482
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,370
I can't maintain
that efficiently.

483
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,890
Because if I insert
at the beginning

484
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:18,340
of my traversal order, then
all the indices change.

485
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,910
So that's an example of a edit.

486
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,530
So if I insert a
new node over here,

487
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,650
so this guy's index
was 0, now it's 1.

488
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,780
This guy's index
was 1, now it's 2.

489
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,430
This was 2, now
it's 3, and so on.

490
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,380
Every node changes its index.

491
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,750
Index is not a subtree
property, and that's

492
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,280
why we can't maintain it.

493
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,497
Because it depends on all
of the nodes in the tree.

494
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:39,330
Or it depends on all
the nodes to its left--

495
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,900
all the predecessors.

496
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,440
So for example, this
guy's index depends

497
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,140
on how many nodes are over
here on the left, which is not

498
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,980
in the subtree of that node.

499
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,400
So that's where you
have to be careful.

500
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,630
Don't use global
properties of the tree.

501
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,760
You can only use
subtree properties.

502
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,755
Another example is depth.

503
00:26:01,755 --> 00:26:08,220
Depth Is annoying to maintain,
but it's not obvious why yet.

504
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,780
We will see that in a moment.

505
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:20,220
The rest of today is about
going from order h order log

506
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,770
n, which is what this
slide is showing us.

507
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,460
So at this point, you should
believe that we can do all

508
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,180
of the sequence data structure
operations in order h time--

509
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,130
except for build and iterate,
which take linear time--

510
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:36,750
and that we can do all of the
set operations in order h time,

511
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,460
except build and
iterate, which take

512
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,620
n log n and n respectively.

513
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:50,790
And our goal is to
now bound h by log n.

514
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,670
We know it's possible
at some level,

515
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:57,450
because there are trees that
have logarithmic height.

516
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,565
That's like this
perfect tree here.

517
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:02,190
But we also know we
have to be careful,

518
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,320
because there are some bad
trees, like this chain.

519
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:15,140
So if h equals log n, we call
this a balanced binary tree.

520
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,200
There are many
balanced binary trees

521
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,302
in the world, maybe
a dozen or two--

522
00:27:24,302 --> 00:27:25,760
a lot of different
data structures.

523
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,260
Question?

524
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,825
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
you said not

525
00:27:28,825 --> 00:27:30,933
to think about things
on a global level

526
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:32,433
so we'll think of
them [INAUDIBLE]..

527
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:34,382
Can you explain what
that means a little more?

528
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:35,840
ERIK DEMAINE: OK,
what does it mean

529
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,520
for a property to be local
to a subtree versus global?

530
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,075
The best answer is
this definition.

531
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:45,200
But that's maybe not the
most intuitive definition.

532
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,033
This is what I mean.

533
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:48,782
Something that can be computed
just knowing information

534
00:27:48,782 --> 00:27:50,240
about your left
and right children,

535
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,220
that is the meaning
of such a property.

536
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,595
And those are the only things
you're allowed to maintain.

537
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:57,320
Because those are
the only things

538
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,500
that are easy to update
by walking up this path.

539
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:06,050
And the contrast is that
global property like index,

540
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,000
it's global, in
particular, because I

541
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,140
can do one change, add one
node, and all of the node's

542
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,030
properties change.

543
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,470
So that's an extreme
example of global.

544
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:20,180
We want this very
particular notion of local,

545
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,570
because that's what we can
actually afford to recompute.

546
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,920
Hopefully that clarifies.

547
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,008
Yeah?

548
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:31,630
AUDIENCE: Doesn't size not
work with that [INAUDIBLE]??

549
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,700
ERIK DEMAINE: You're
right that if we added--

550
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,255
oh, no.

551
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:35,380
OK, let's think about that.

552
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,340
If we added a new
parent to the tree--

553
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,600
this is not something
that we've ever done.

554
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,500
But even if we did that,
which subtrees change?

555
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,740
Only this one.

556
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,410
This node, it's a
totally new subtree.

557
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,780
But the subtree of this node
is completely unchanged.

558
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,655
Because subtrees are
always downward looking,

559
00:28:54,655 --> 00:28:58,270
if I added a new root, I
didn't change any subtrees

560
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,890
except for one.

561
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,790
So size is a subtree property.

562
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,490
Now, there are--

563
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,510
I mean, I could completely
redraw the tree.

564
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,510
And that's an operation
that requires everything

565
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,980
to be recomputed.

566
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,740
So it is limited exactly what
I'm allowed to do in the tree.

567
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,960
But I claim everything
we'll do, last class

568
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,410
and today, we can afford
this augmentation.

569
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:21,100
So it's a feature, not of
all binary trees necessarily,

570
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,600
but of the ones
that we would cover.

571
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,100
Yeah?

572
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,395
AUDIENCE: What is a min?

573
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:25,562
ERIK DEMAINE: What is a min?

574
00:29:25,562 --> 00:29:27,370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

575
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:31,360
ERIK DEMAINE: Binary tree, yeah.

576
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,260
OK, this will make a little
more sense in a moment

577
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,100
when I say what we're actually
going to do with trees.

578
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,830
We need a new tool for
manipulating a tree.

579
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,530
What we've done so far, we've
done some swapping of items.

580
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,110
And we did adding
and removing a leaf.

581
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,010
That's not enough.

582
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,990
We're going to need
something else to let us

583
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,320
guarantee logarithmic height.

584
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,900
And that something else
is called a rotation.

585
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:15,350
What does this something
else need to do?

586
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,470
This is just a tool for
rebalancing the tree.

587
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,280
So it should not change the data
that's represented by the tree.

588
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,320
What is the data
represented by the tree?

589
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,940
Traversal order.

590
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,660
Traversal order is sacrosanct.

591
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,910
We're not allowed to touch it.

592
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,250
It's already defined
two different ways,

593
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,410
depending on whether you're
using a set or sequence.

594
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,130
So we want to modify the
tree in a way that doesn't

595
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,380
modify the traversal order.

596
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,510
So we're exploiting redundancy.

597
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,820
If you wrote down the
traversal order in an array,

598
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,590
there's exactly
one representation

599
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,940
of a given order.

600
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,340
But in a tree, there's
many representations.

601
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,840
It could be a long line.

602
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,520
It could be a balance thing.

603
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,770
They could represent the
exact same order on the nodes

604
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,600
if you label them right.

605
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,300
In fact, there are exponentially
many different representations

606
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,050
of the same thing.

607
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:04,880
And we're going to exploit that,
the same order, and define--

608
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,560
this is just a thing
you need to know.

609
00:31:20,364 --> 00:31:27,820
Let me label, A, X, B,
Y, C. You can tell I've

610
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,570
drawn this diagram
before many, many times.

611
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:35,060
This is a very powerful tool
in all tree data structures,

612
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,060
which are most of
data structures.

613
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:46,940
And they are called right rotate
of y and left rotate of x.

614
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,730
So if I have this tree--

615
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,150
which I'm just black
boxing some of the subtrees

616
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,410
into little triangles.

617
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,860
If I have a node, and
it has a left child,

618
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,590
then I'm allowed to right rotate
this edge, which means take

619
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,000
this edge and go like this--

620
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,058
90 degrees, kind of.

621
00:32:09,058 --> 00:32:11,350
Or you could just think of
it as rewriting it this way.

622
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:14,290
Now, you might also have keeping
track of the parent pointer.

623
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,720
Parent pointer moves around.

624
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,610
Before, this was
the parent of y.

625
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,980
Now it's the parent of x.

626
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,980
So x and y are switching places.

627
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,610
But we couldn't just
swap these items around,

628
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,980
because that would
change traversal order.

629
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,440
In this picture,
x comes before y,

630
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,850
because x is in the left
subtree of y in traversal order.

631
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,000
And over here, now y is
in the right subtree of x.

632
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,350
So it comes after x.

633
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,600
So in both cases,
x comes before y.

634
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,610
And indeed, in all of these
pictures the traversal order--

635
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,520
I mean, not just for x and
y, but also for A, B, and C,

636
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,170
the traversal order
is consistent.

637
00:32:53,170 --> 00:33:01,975
It is A, X, B, y, C, where,
when I write a triangle,

638
00:33:01,975 --> 00:33:03,850
I mean recursively the
traversal order of all

639
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,578
the things in the triangle.

640
00:33:05,578 --> 00:33:07,870
So if you just apply the
traversal order algorithm here

641
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,830
versus here, you
get the same output,

642
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,970
which means these operations
preserve traversal order.

643
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,380
Great, so this is
a thing that we

644
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,890
can do in a tree that won't
affect any of the stuff

645
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,330
we've done so far.

646
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,670
It's a tool that we
can use to rebalance.

647
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:34,190
Notice how deep things
are in the tree changes.

648
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,310
Our problem with
this linear tree

649
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,200
is that there are some
nodes of linear depth.

650
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,440
We want to get rid of those.

651
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:40,940
How?

652
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,030
Well, we could take these edges
and start rotating them up.

653
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,850
If you look at depths,
in this picture,

654
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:51,650
A and B are deeper than
C. And in this picture,

655
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:55,100
B and C are deeper than
A. So it's a trade off.

656
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,470
This one moved up.

657
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,490
This one moved down.

658
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,040
This one stayed
at the same depth.

659
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:07,130
So hopefully, if A is too
deep and C is too shallow,

660
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,935
they can trade off like this.

661
00:34:08,935 --> 00:34:11,120
It may sound difficult,
but in fact, there's

662
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:18,770
a pretty simple way, which
are called AVL trees, that

663
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:24,439
maintain balance in a particular
way called height balance.

664
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:42,710
This is if we take the
height of node.left--

665
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,500
actually, I'd prefer to--

666
00:34:50,080 --> 00:35:03,190
node.right, minus
height of node.left,

667
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:11,050
so this thing is called
skew of the node.

668
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:15,040
I want this to always be
minus 1, 0, or plus 1.

669
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:21,930
So this is saying that
if I have any node,

670
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:25,372
and I look if its left
subtree and its right subtree,

671
00:35:25,372 --> 00:35:26,830
I measure their
heights-- remember,

672
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:30,670
that's downward distance,
maximum distance to a leaf--

673
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,138
I measure the height
of this tree--

674
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:34,180
maximum height-- and I
measure the maximum height

675
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:39,012
of this subtree, I want these
to be within 1 of each other.

676
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:39,970
Ideally, they're equal.

677
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,740
That would be the perfect case.

678
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,140
But let's let them differ by 1.

679
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:48,220
So maybe this is k
and this is k plus 1.

680
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,670
Or maybe this is k
and this is k minus 1.

681
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,730
In this picture, what is
the height of this node?

682
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,812
It's good practice.

683
00:35:56,812 --> 00:35:59,560
k plus 2, good.

684
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,780
What's the longest path
from this node to a leaf?

685
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,460
Well, it could go
through this subtree.

686
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,160
And that would be length k
plus 1, because it's k in here

687
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,570
plus 1 for this edge.

688
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,450
Or it could be through here,
and that's k plus 1 plus 1.

689
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,380
So the biggest is
to go to the right.

690
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,860
So the height-- if I told you
the height of these subtrees,

691
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,443
we can derive the
height of this node.

692
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:19,490
We're going to use
that a lot in a moment.

693
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,490
So, the first claim
is that if I could

694
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:26,620
maintain height
balance, then I will

695
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,640
guarantee that h equals log n.

696
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,180
So in other words, height
balance implies balance.

697
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,260
So let's prove
that first quickly.

698
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,505
And then, the interesting part
is how do we actually prove--

699
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,825
or how do we actually
maintain the balance property?

700
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:49,450
We're going to do
that using rotations.

701
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,490
But how is a big question.

702
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:07,420
So why does height
balance imply balance?

703
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:21,530
So what this is saying is
that all height balanced trees

704
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,810
have logarithmic height.

705
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,390
So what I'd like
to think about is

706
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:30,890
sort of the least balanced
height balanced tree.

707
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:36,070
The least balanced one is going
to have every node a mismatch.

708
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:39,170
Let's say the left
subtree is shallower

709
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,800
than the right subtree by 1, and
recursively all the way down.

710
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,650
So every node has
a gap here, a--

711
00:37:49,522 --> 00:37:51,480
what do we call it--

712
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,520
a skew of 1, which
I'm going to write--

713
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,090
I'm going to introduce
some notation.

714
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,360
I'll write a dissenting
rightward arrow of this one

715
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,165
is higher than the left subtree.

716
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,270
So the easy way to
think about this

717
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,120
is this is sort
of our worst case.

718
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,260
This is going to be the fewest
nodes for the maximum depth.

719
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:18,370
Let's just count how many
nodes are in this tree.

720
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:21,310
I'm going to write that
as a recurrence, which

721
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:25,660
is the number of nodes
in a tree of height h.

722
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:32,680
So if this whole tree has height
h, as we said in this picture,

723
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,750
if I just subtract 2
from all these numbers,

724
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:40,270
then this one has
height h minus 2,

725
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:44,020
and this one has
height h minus 1.

726
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,833
So how many nodes are in here?

727
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:47,750
Well, this is a recurrence
I'm going to write.

728
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:52,060
So this will be N sub h minus 2.

729
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,360
This will be N sub h minus 1.

730
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,910
And then I just count how many
nodes are in this picture.

731
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:06,100
It is Nh minus 1 plus Nh
minus 2 plus 1, or this node.

732
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,520
Now you might ask, what
is Nh a recurrence for?

733
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,760
But it is the number of nodes
in this sort of worst case

734
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,460
if the worst case
has total height h.

735
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,350
So you can also
think of it as what

736
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,090
is the minimum number
of nodes I could

737
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,780
have in an AVL tree, which is
a height balanced tree, that

738
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:38,610
has a height h in a
height balanced tree?

739
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,920
OK, so now I just need
to solve this recurrence.

740
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,450
This recurrence
look familiar-ish?

741
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,550
It's like Fibonacci numbers.

742
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,130
If I remove the plus
1, it's Fibonacci.

743
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,320
And if you happen to know
the Fibonacci numbers grow

744
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,690
as, like, a golden
ratio to the n,

745
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,490
then we know that
this is exponential,

746
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,540
which is what we want.

747
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,690
Because if Nh is
exponential in h,

748
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,670
that means h is
logarithmic in N,

749
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,618
because log is inverse
of exponential.

750
00:40:06,618 --> 00:40:08,660
But maybe you don't know
about Fibonacci numbers.

751
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:14,300
And so we can still easily
show that this is exponential

752
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,960
as follows.

753
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,260
I want to prove that it's
at least an exponential,

754
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:22,830
because that gives me that
h is at most logarithmic.

755
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,183
So we need a lower bound.

756
00:40:24,183 --> 00:40:26,600
And so we have these two terms
which are hard to compare--

757
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,850
Nh minus 1 and Nh minus 2.

758
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,212
It's kind of ugly.

759
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:31,670
But if we're allowed
to be sloppy--

760
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,460
and we'll see if
we're not too sloppy--

761
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,570
and still get an
exponential answer,

762
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:40,115
let's just make
them equal like so.

763
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:48,140
So this is a true statement,
in fact, strictly greater than.

764
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:48,680
Why?

765
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,420
Because I removed the plus 1.

766
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,310
That should only make
something smaller.

767
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,600
And I replaced Nh minus
1 with Nh minus 2.

768
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,310
Here, I'm implicitly
using a fact,

769
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:03,170
which is obvious by induction,
that this tree on height--

770
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,270
if I take this tree
versus this tree,

771
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,850
this one has more
nodes than this one.

772
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,130
If I have larger height,
this construction

773
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:13,250
is going to build a bigger
tree, at least as big.

774
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,710
It doesn't even need
to be strictly bigger.

775
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:18,140
So certainly, Nh minus 1
is greater than or equal

776
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,060
to Nh minus 2.

777
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:24,230
Now, this is 2 times Nh minus 2.

778
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,710
And this is an easy recurrence.

779
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,920
This is just powers of 2.

780
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,460
I keep multiplying by 2,
and subtracting 2 from h.

781
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:35,150
So this solves to
2 to the h over 2,

782
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,880
maybe with a floor or something.

783
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:43,490
But I'm using a base case here,
which is N sub 0 equals 1.

784
00:41:46,187 --> 00:41:47,270
Maybe it's a ceiling then.

785
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,380
But the point is
this is exponential.

786
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,810
So this implies that the height
is always, at most, 2 times

787
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,730
log n.

788
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,810
This 2 corresponds to this 2.

789
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,750
If you just invert
this formula, this

790
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:04,500
was a number of nodes is
going to be at least 2

791
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,600
to the h over 2.

792
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,710
And so h is, at most, 2 log n.

793
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,913
So it's not log n.

794
00:42:08,913 --> 00:42:09,830
That would be perfect.

795
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:12,020
But it's within a
factor of 2 of log n.

796
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:15,510
So AVL trees are
always quite balanced.

797
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,090
Number of levels
is at most double

798
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,710
what you need to store n nodes.

799
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,210
Great.

800
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:27,730
We're left with the main magic--

801
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:28,780
not domain magic.

802
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,060
That's different.

803
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:34,180
And let's see, we're going
to use subtree augmentation.

804
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,150
Keep that.

805
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:48,330
Big remaining
challenge is how do we

806
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:51,240
maintain this high balance
property using rotations?

807
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,190
We have all the ingredients
lined up for us.

808
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,670
We have subtree augmentation.

809
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,810
What does that let me do?

810
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,710
It's relevant to AVL trees.

811
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:06,880
Well, it lets me store height.

812
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,230
I need to be able to compute
the height of a node.

813
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:13,090
That, in general,
takes linear time,

814
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,173
because I have to look at
all the downward paths--

815
00:43:15,173 --> 00:43:16,660
all the leaves
within that subtree.

816
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,520
But height is a
subtree property--

817
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:27,470
so, yes-- height.

818
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:28,920
Why?

819
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,670
Because-- let me
just write it here--

820
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:49,140
node.height equals 1 plus
max of node.left.height

821
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:57,150
and node.right.height
and of max.

822
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,390
Let me put this in a box.

823
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:05,550
This equation, or I guess
it's an assignment operation--

824
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,267
this is a 1--

825
00:44:08,267 --> 00:44:10,100
is the thing we've been
doing over and over.

826
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,660
When I said what is the
height of this node,

827
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,890
you just figured
that out, right?

828
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,495
You took the height of
the left subtree maxed

829
00:44:14,495 --> 00:44:15,995
with the height of
the right subtree

830
00:44:15,995 --> 00:44:19,250
and added 1 to account
for these edges.

831
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,930
So this is a
general update rule.

832
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:23,540
It matches this subtree
property pattern.

833
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,280
If I have the property
of left and right,

834
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,800
I can compute it for node.

835
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,570
And this takes
constant time to do.

836
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,900
And so it's a subtree property.

837
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,388
And so I can maintain, through
all the things I'm doing,

838
00:44:33,388 --> 00:44:34,430
the height of every node.

839
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:37,800
Oh by the way, whenever
I do a rotation,

840
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,180
I'm also going to have to
update my subtree properties.

841
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,720
When I rotate this edge, A does
not change, B does not change,

842
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,710
C does not change.

843
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,080
So that's good.

844
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,685
But x's subtree changes.

845
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:50,840
It now has y.

846
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,320
It didn't before.

847
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,620
So we're going to have to also
update the augmentation here

848
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,970
in y.

849
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:03,550
And we're going to have to
update the augmentation in x.

850
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:04,940
And we're going
to have to update

851
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:10,280
the augmentation of all of
the ancestors of x eventually.

852
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,660
So rotation is
locally just changing

853
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,910
a constant number of pointers.

854
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:18,050
So I usually think of rotations
as taking constant time.

855
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,835
But eventually, we
will have to do--

856
00:45:20,835 --> 00:45:22,085
this is constant time locally.

857
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:35,720
But we will need to update
h ancestors in order

858
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,162
to store all of-- keep all of
our augmentations up to date.

859
00:45:39,162 --> 00:45:40,370
We'll worry about that later.

860
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,250
All right, so great.

861
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,917
Now we have the height
of all the nodes.

862
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:50,860
We can compute the skew
of all the nodes, cool.

863
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,570
We have this rotation operation.

864
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:58,320
And we want to maintain this
height balance property.

865
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,130
Height of left node-- left
and right of every node--

866
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,630
is plus or minus 1, or 0.

867
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:13,740
Cool, so I said over here
somewhere, whenever we--

868
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,365
so the only things
that change the tree

869
00:46:15,365 --> 00:46:17,630
are when we insert
or delete a new node.

870
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:20,210
And the way that we
implemented those so far

871
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,950
is to add or remove a leaf.

872
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:24,660
So we should still be thinking
about adding or removing

873
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,160
a leaf.

874
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,410
The problem is, when
I add a new leaf,

875
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:31,320
now maybe this tree is
higher than it used to be.

876
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:35,270
So some node here may no
longer be height balanced.

877
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:37,220
But because height is
a subtree property,

878
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,590
the only nodes we
need to check are

879
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:42,330
the ones up this ancestor path.

880
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:44,900
And there's only log n of them,
because now height is log n.

881
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,660
That's what we just proved as
long as we have this property.

882
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,450
Now, we right now don't
have it for, like,

883
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:51,620
maybe these few nodes.

884
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,570
But it was long n before.

885
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:54,470
It's at most log n--

886
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:58,250
2 log n plus 1 right now,
because we just added a node.

887
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,920
So what I want to do is
check all of these ancestor

888
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,310
nodes in sequence from
bottom up, and find

889
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:06,550
one that's out of balance.

890
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:15,710
So let's take the lowest
out of balance node.

891
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,860
I'm going to call that x.

892
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,370
Now, because we just insert
or deleted a single leaf,

893
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:32,090
it's only out of balance
by 1, because we only

894
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:33,590
changed height--

895
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:36,710
one height went up by 1, or
one height went down by 1.

896
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:40,730
And before, all of our skews
were plus or minus 1, or 0.

897
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:44,223
So now, it's-- the bad case
is when it's plus or minus 2.

898
00:47:44,223 --> 00:47:46,640
If it happens to still be in
this range for all the nodes,

899
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,510
we're happy.

900
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:51,080
But if it's outside this range,
it's only going to be out by 1.

901
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:58,550
So this means the skew
is n plus 2 or minus 2.

902
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:01,910
And let's say that
it's 2 by symmetry.

903
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:06,098
So my picture is--

904
00:48:06,098 --> 00:48:10,010
I'm going to draw
double right arrow

905
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:18,590
to say that this subtree is
2 higher than this subtree.

906
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:21,320
OK, so that's bad and
we want to fix it.

907
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:25,265
The obvious thing to do
is to rotate this edge.

908
00:48:25,265 --> 00:48:26,390
Because that'll make this--

909
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:31,590
this is too high
and this is too low.

910
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:33,410
So if we rotate, this
should go down by 1

911
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,550
and this should go up by 1.

912
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:38,070
And that works most of the time.

913
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:45,200
So case one is the skew of y.

914
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:45,860
What is y?

915
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:50,090
I want y to be the
right child of x.

916
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:54,260
Because we have a positive skew,
we know there is a right child.

917
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,120
Now, because this was
the lowest bad node,

918
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,770
we know that y is actually good.

919
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:02,300
It's either right heavy--
or even the two subtrees

920
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,820
have the same height--
or left heavy.

921
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:13,940
The easy cases
are when skew of y

922
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:22,720
is either 1 or 0,
which I will draw.

923
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,630
So a double right arrow,
let's say single right arrow--

924
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:44,020
so I'm just going to
add some labels here

925
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:48,562
to make this
picture consistent--

926
00:49:48,562 --> 00:49:51,210
k plus 1, k plus 2.

927
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,770
I'm riding the heights.

928
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:56,010
So this is an example
where C is taller

929
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:58,947
than B. A and B are
the same height.

930
00:49:58,947 --> 00:50:00,780
And then if you compute
the heights up here,

931
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,480
indeed this one
is right leaning.

932
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,220
This one is doubly
right leaning.

933
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,850
Because this one
has height k plus 1.

934
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:08,100
This one has height k minus 1.

935
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:08,890
That's bad.

936
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:11,370
But if we do this
right rotation on x,

937
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:14,100
we get exactly what we want.

938
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:20,940
So I'm just going to copy
the labels on A, B, C--

939
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,760
we have k minus 1,
k minus 1, and k--

940
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,630
and then recompute.

941
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,400
That means this
guy has height k,

942
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,040
this one has height k plus 1.

943
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,653
And now, all the nodes in this
picture that I've highlighted--

944
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:32,820
A, B, and C haven't changed.

945
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,195
They were height
balanced before.

946
00:50:34,195 --> 00:50:35,400
They still are.

947
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,720
But now, x and y--

948
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,030
x wasn't height
balanced before, y was.

949
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,420
Now, both x and y
are height balanced.

950
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,160
That's case one.

951
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,390
In case two, the
skew of y is flat,

952
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:54,870
which means that this
is a k, and this is a k,

953
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:58,570
and this is a k plus 1,
and this is a k plus 2.

954
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:00,743
But still, all the
nodes are balanced--

955
00:51:00,743 --> 00:51:01,410
height balanced.

956
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:03,090
They're still plus or minus 1.

957
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:04,440
So those are the easy cases.

958
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,240
Unfortunately, there
is a hard case--

959
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,280
case three.

960
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,280
But there's only one, and
it's not that much harder.

961
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:21,780
So it's when skew
of y is minus 1.

962
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,750
In this case, we need to
look at the left child of y.

963
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:31,830
And to be alphabetical, I'm
going to rename this to z.

964
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:36,780
So this one, again,
is double right arrow.

965
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,540
This one is now left arrow.

966
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,910
And this is letter y.

967
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:49,950
And so we have A, B, C, and D
potential subtrees hanging off

968
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:50,550
of them.

969
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:54,310
And I'm going to label the
heights of these things.

970
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:59,010
These are each k
minus 1 or k minus 2.

971
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:00,420
This one's k minus 1.

972
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,770
And now, compute the inside.

973
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:06,690
So this is going to height k
for this to be left leaning.

974
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:11,520
So this is k plus 1,
and this is k plus 2.

975
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,680
But the problem is this
is 2 higher than this.

976
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,370
The height of z is 2 higher
than the height of A.

977
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:18,990
This case, if I
do this rotation,

978
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:20,910
things get worse, actually.

979
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:26,610
I'll just tell you the
right thing to do is--

980
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,650
this is the one thing
you need to memorize.

981
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,860
And let me draw the results.

982
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,300
You can also just think of it
as redrawing the tree like this.

983
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,940
But it's easier from
an analysis perspective

984
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,680
to think about it
as two rotations.

985
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,940
Then we can just reduce.

986
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,800
As long as we know
how rotations work,

987
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,460
then we know that
this thing works--

988
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:59,060
"works" meaning it
preserves traversal order

989
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,160
and we can maintain
all the augmentations.

990
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,340
So now, if I copy over these
labels-- the height labels--

991
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,390
I have k minus 1.

992
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:08,600
I have, for these two guys,
k minus 1 or k minus 2.

993
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,100
The biggest one is k minus 1.

994
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,190
This is k minus 1.

995
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,410
And so this will be k.

996
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:17,450
This will be k.

997
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:19,070
This will be k plus 1.

998
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:22,490
And lo and behold, we have
a nice, height balanced tree

999
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,760
in all three cases
for this one node.

1000
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,020
Now, this was the lowest node.

1001
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,880
Once we update
this one, it could

1002
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,090
be that we changed the
height of the root.

1003
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:35,750
Before it was k plus
2, now it's k plus 1.

1004
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:39,483
Or sometimes, we keep it the
same, like over in this case.

1005
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:41,150
And so now, we have
to check the parent.

1006
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:42,740
Maybe the parent
is out of balance.

1007
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,720
And we just keep
walking up the node,

1008
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,660
and also maintain all the
augmentations as we go.

1009
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,790
Then, we'll keep track of
height and subtree size

1010
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:51,980
if we want them, or any
other augmentations.

1011
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,425
And after order h
operations, we will

1012
00:53:54,425 --> 00:53:56,300
have restored height
balanced property, which

1013
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,280
means all the way through,
h equals order log n.

1014
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,250
And so all of our operations
now are magically order log n.
